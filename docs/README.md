# Docs

## Overview

This folder contains two subfolders - `user` and `contributor`. 

The [`user`](./user/README.md) subfolder contains the end-user documentation.

The [`contributor`](./contributor/README.md) subfolder includes any developer-related documentation to help them manually install, develop, and operate the component.
